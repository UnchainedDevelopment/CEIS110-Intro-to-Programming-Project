CEIS 110 Intro to Programming Weather Data Analysis
Overview

Welcome to the CEIS 110 Intro to Programming Weather Data Analysis repository by Unchained Development, owned by Joseph Brisendine. This repository serves as the storage house for the program developed for the CEIS 110 course project. The purpose of this project is to analyze weather data, and this README file provides information about the project, its purpose, and how to use it.
Project Description

The CEIS 110 Intro to Programming Weather Data Analysis project aims to develop a program to analyze weather data. This program will assist in processing, visualizing, and extracting insights from weather data sets, helping to fulfill the course project requirements.
Features

    Data Import: The program allows you to import weather data from various sources, such as CSV files or web APIs.

    Data Analysis: Perform basic statistical analysis on the weather data, including calculations for mean, median, maximum, and minimum values.

    Data Visualization: Create visualizations, such as graphs and charts, to help users understand weather trends.

    User-Friendly Interface: The program will have an intuitive user interface to make it accessible for all users, even those with limited programming experience.

Getting Started

To use this program, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

    shell
